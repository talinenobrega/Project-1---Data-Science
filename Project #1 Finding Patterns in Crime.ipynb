    "\n",
    "- **Granularity**: Areas that are too small aren't great, because only a few crimes were committed inside them, which makes it hard to analyze and compare. \n",
    "- **Comprehensibility**: the data provided should be easy to understand.\n",
    "- **Missing values**: these may compromise the data analysis. So, it is recommended to use a group of data that does not have missing values. \n",

    "The Comprehensibility factor is determined by the clarity in understanding the data. Parameters that depend on prior interpretation may be not simple to understand. For example, it is necessary to have a minimum knowledge about maps orientation to interpret latitude and longitude parameters. Therefore, the columns that provide simple interpretation is **Police District Name** and **Police District Number**\n",

    "In section 2 was discussed about the structure of the data. In that section was presented how many NaN values each column of the data presents. This information is crucial to determiny which column is more apropriate based on the criteria **Mission value**. According to the results presented on that section, the columns related to location that do not have missing value are: **Police District Name**, **Block Address** and **Police District Number**\n",
